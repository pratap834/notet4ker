Doctor: Good afternoon. Please have a seat. Can I start by confirming your name?

Patient: Yes, it's Janet Jones.

Doctor: Thank you, Ms. Jones. So, you're here about your car accident, is that right?

Patient: Yes, Doctor. I was in a car accident on September 1st, and I'm still having some issues.

Doctor: I see. Can you tell me what happened?

Patient: Well, I was driving when someone rear-ended me at a traffic light. My head jerked back quite hard.

Doctor: And what symptoms have you been experiencing?

Patient: Right after the accident, I had a bad headache and my neck was really stiff. The neck pain was the worst part—it lasted for about four weeks. I also had some back pain that came and went.

Doctor: Did you seek treatment immediately?

Patient: Yes, I went to the hospital emergency room the same day. They said I had whiplash and gave me some painkillers.

Doctor: How has your recovery been?

Patient: The first month was rough. The pain was pretty severe. But then I started physiotherapy—I've had about 10 sessions so far—and that's helped a lot. The neck pain is mostly gone now, though I still get the occasional backache.

Doctor: Let me examine you. Can you turn your head to the left... and to the right... Good. Any pain?

Patient: No, not really. Maybe a tiny bit of stiffness, but nothing like before.

Doctor: Excellent. Your range of motion looks good. Based on what you've told me and the examination, I'd say you're recovering well from the whiplash injury.

Patient: So, do you think I'll make a full recovery?

Doctor: Yes, I'm optimistic. Most people with whiplash recover completely within six months, and you're already showing significant improvement.

Patient: That's reassuring. Thank you, Doctor.

Doctor: You're welcome. If your symptoms worsen, come back and see me. Otherwise, I think you're on the right track.
